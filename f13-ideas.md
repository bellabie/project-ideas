Fall 2013 Ideas

As a lover of music, I have an idea for a project that somehow visually demonstrates the emotions that music incites within people. Music is a significant part of pop culture, but it is also an essential part of our lives in general. It has been proven to affect our moods, the quality of our work, and the way we think. I think it is important to draw attention to that. The only idea that I have so far on how to do this would be with some kind of sound activated, volume sensitive lighting. People tend to feel more profound emotions when music gets louder, whether it be because of volume, or because of added instruments or layers of sound. So I picture more lights being on, or the lights being brighter, as a result of the music getting louder. Possibly something similar to [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxpu41EQ78s). I'm still unsure about how to incorporate it into a wearable object, but I believe it should be worn on the torso area of the body to symbolize the emotions that "run through you" when you are listening.

I've been exploring several ideas around the idea of privacy. I am a member of the school's Computer Security Group where I am giving a demonstration on physical security. In researching this topic, I've been learning about the many facets of pervasive security culture (be it CCTV, RFID-controlled, auto-locking doors, or cell phone monitoring). The project ideas that I've come up with are varied. Some are closer to ready-to-wear design intended to maximize utility. Other concepts are intended more as statement pieces, avant garde and impractical. The utility ideas are: IR-shielding clothing, an RFID-snatching wand/sleeve/glove/garment, taser-proof clothing, and a compact that——instead of [just?] showing your reflection——tells you if you can be recognized by facial identification software. On the more performative end of things: literal cages that act as Faraday cages, masking the wearers from detection through cell signal; security camera themed clothing; fake Google Glass; an orange prison jumpsuit with a live counter on incarceration numbers; and a cell phone case that is connected with a cuff of a handcuff, called "Tethered." I want to play with the concepts of security, privacy, and guilt by juxtaposing the contemporary with the dystopian-sounding predictions of the past that describes so perfectly our modern world (Brave New World, 1984, V for Vendetta, &c.).
